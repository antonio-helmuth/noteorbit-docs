Cursor AI Prompt for NoteOrbit Implementation
Build the complete NoteOrbit app exactly as specified in these docs. Read EVERY single document thoroughly before writing any code, then implement precisely what's described:

System Architecture
Feature Specifications
UI Component Library & Best Practices
API Architecture & Data Management

DO NOT deviate from the specs under any circumstances. Follow the exact folder structure, component design, API patterns, and state management. Implement ALL features as documented - auth flow, note CRUD, access control, locking mechanism, and markdown editor. Use only the specified technologies (Next.js, Clerk, PostgreSQL, react-markdown-editor-lite). If unclear, refer back to the docs rather than inventing your own solutions.
Create the entire application according to the specifications. No shortcuts.
